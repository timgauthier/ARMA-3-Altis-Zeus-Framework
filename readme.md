ARMA 3 - Altis Zeus Mission Framework.
================

A Mission for Arma 3 on Altis using Zeus and some mods. This mission allows for a cooperative game played on the Altis map that is has a Zeus Game-Master and Moderator. The framework has added the ability for the moderators to add some scripted functions such as VAS Weapons menu's to be added to some objects in the mission.


##Mods in the Mission

* [HLC AK Pack v1.1](http://www.armaholic.com/page.php?id=25099)
* [HLC Core v0.2a](http://www.armaholic.com/page.php?id=24620)
* [ASDG Joint Rails v.8](http://www.armaholic.com/page.php?id=23242)
* [AI Combat Skills & AI Spotting](http://www.armaholic.com/page.php?id=8250)

##Roadmap

The goal and outline for this framework is to be used for various modpacks and mission types. We want to have a framework or bed in place within this mission to allow for the use of various mods in co-ordination with the Zeus DLC for ARMA 3. Our personal flavour of this will include F3, MCC, and Russians likely at this time.

##TO-Do
Things to do, or add on, not yet implimented but wanting to use.

* Find a russian forces mod to use.
* Find improvements for the Zeus system, add new prefab things.
